# discordSlav
The discordSlav will allow you to set custom commands and who it can interact to (e.g. your friends).

It is written purely in NodeJS and has 2 dependencies: **node-cmd** and **Discord.js**.

## Warning
The software is written AS-IS and no guarantees will be provided if (_cough_) your server gets compromised. It is HIGHLY suggested that you run this under an unprivileged user.

## Installation 
Installation is relatively simple. You'll need to have `NodeJS` installed (obviously) and `screen`.

When you do have them installed, all you need to to is open a screen up and run the bot:

    cd ~
    mkdir bot
    
    screen S bot
    node bot.js


Have fun!
